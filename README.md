Relatedness Calculator Interface
=========================

The Relatedness Calculator Interface is a simple tool to help make sense of family
trees.  Genealogy is interesting stuff, and it's got pretty universal appeal. But it
gets complicated once you start talking about second cousins, half-nephews, and ever
more distant relations.

The goal of this webapp is to make available to the broader public some basic facts
about family relatedness.  I try not to dumb anything down, and I try not to give explicit
advice about intra-family marriage (although some people might try to use it for that).
What I'm mostly hoping for is just the gee-whiz factor of "Wow, my half-brother's 
only as closely related to me as my grandma!" Or "Huh, so that's what a second cousin is."

The code itself is just a Grails frontend to the [Relatedness Calculator][2] Java library.

This app is licensed using the [WTFPL][1], but I'd appreciate attribution if you
want to re-use any of it.
