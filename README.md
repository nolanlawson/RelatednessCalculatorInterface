Relatedness Calculator Interface
=========================

This is a Grails interface to the [Relatedness Calculator][2] Java project.  It simply acts
as a Grails frontend to the core parsing/calculating components.

This app is licensed using the [WTFPL][1], but it would be super sweet if you'd give me attribution
and stuff. Just don't be a jerk.
